<h3>Key tips for safe and responsible cookie-based Web browsing</h3>

<p>Due to their flexibility and the fact that many of the largest and most-visited websites use cookies by default, cookies are almost unavoidable. Disabling cookies will lock a user out of many of the most widely-used sites on the Internet like Youtube, Gmail, Yahoo mail, and others. Even search settings require cookies for language settings. Here are some tips you can use to ensure worry-free cookie-based browsing: Customize your browser's cookie settings to reflect your comfort level with cookie security or use the cookie cleaner included in Abine's free Privacy Suite.</p>

<p>If you are very comfortable with cookies and you are the only person using your computer, you may want to set long expiration time frames for storing your personal access information and browsing history. If you share access on your computer, you may want to set your browser to clear private browsing data every time you close your browser.</p>

<p>While not as secure as rejecting cookies outright, this option lets you access cookie-based websites while deleting any sensitive information after your browsing session. Install and keep antispyware applications updated Many spyware detection, cleanup applications, and spyware removers include attack site detection. They block your browser from accessing websites designed to exploit browser vulnerabilities or download malicious software. Make sure your browser is updated If you haven't already, set your browser to update automatically. This eliminates security vulnerabilities caused by outdated browsers. Many cookie-based exploits are based on exploiting older browsers' security shortcomings. Cookies are everywhere and can't really be avoided if you wish to enjoy the biggest and best websites out there. With a clear understanding of how they operate and how they help your browsing experience, you can take the necessary security measures to ensure that you browse the Net confidently.</p>

However if you are still looking for more information then you can contact us through one of our preferred contact methods.</p>
